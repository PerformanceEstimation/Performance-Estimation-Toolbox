function K_ThreeOperatorSplitting
% In this example, we use the three operator splitting (TOS)
% method for solving the composite convex minimization problem
%   min_x { F(x) = f_1(x) + f_2(x) + f_3(x) }
%   (for notational convenience we denote xs=argmin_x F(x);
% where f_1 is L-smooth and mu-strongly convex, f_2 is closed, convex
% and proper, and f_3 is smooth convex. Proximal operators are 
% assumed to be available for f_1 and f_2.
%
% We show how to compute a contraction factor for the iterates of TOS 
% (i.e., how do the iterates contract when the algorithm is started from
% two different initial points).%
%
% Our notations for the TOS algorithm are as follows:
%       x_k     = prox_{\alpha f2}(w_k)
%       y_k     = prox_{\alpha f1}(2*x_k-w_k -\alpha f3'(x_k))
%       w_{k+1} = w_k +\theta (y_k - x_k)
%
% and our goal is to compute the smallest contraction factor rho such that
% when the algorithm is started from two different points w_0 and w_0', we
% have ||w_1 - w_1'||^2 <= rho^2 ||w_0 - w_0'||^2.
%
% Details on the SDP formulations can be found in 
% [1] Ernest K. Ryu, Adrien B. Taylor, Carolina Bergeling,
%     and Pontus Giselsson. "Operator splitting performance estimation:
%     Tight contraction factors and optimal parameter selection." (2018)
%
% The TOS is introduced in
% [2] Damek Davis, and Wotao Yin. "A three-operator splitting scheme
%     and its optimization applications." Set-valued and variational
%     analysis  (2017).

paramf1.L  = 10;        % Smoothness parameter of f1
paramf3.L  = 1;         % Smoothness parameter of f3

f1 = P.DeclareFunction('SmoothStronglyConvex',paramf1);
f2 = P.DeclareFunction('Convex');
f3 = P.DeclareFunction('SmoothStronglyConvex',paramf3);
F  = f1 + f2 + f3; % F is the objective function

% (2) Set up the starting points and initial condition
w0   = P.StartingPoint(); % w0 is some starting point
w0p  = P.StartingPoint(); % w0' is some starting point

P.InitialCondition((w0-w0p)^2<=1); % Initial condition ||w0-w0'||^2<= 1
